# Nudges Implementation

This document outlines the implementation of the Nudges feature in the AI Journaling application.

## Overview

The Nudges feature is designed to provide users with personalized and actionable insights based on their journal entries. The goal is to help users identify patterns in their thoughts and emotions, and to encourage them to take positive actions.

## Nudge Engine

The core of the Nudges feature is the Nudge Engine, which is located in `backend/src/util/nudgeEngine.js`. The Nudge Engine is a simple rules engine that analyzes journal patterns and generates nudges based on a set of predefined rules.

## Nudge Types

The following are the different types of nudges that can be generated:

- **LOW_SENTIMENT_DAY:** This nudge is triggered when a user has a consistently low sentiment on a specific day of the week.
- **NEW_USER_WELCOME:** This nudge is sent to new users to welcome them to the application and encourage them to write their first journal entry.
- **MISSING_ENTRIES:** This nudge is sent to users who have not written a journal entry in a certain number of days.
- **NEGATIVE_TREND:** This nudge is triggered when a user's mood has been declining over a certain period of time.
- **POSITIVE_MOMENTUM:** This nudge is sent to users whose mood has been improving over a certain period of time.
- **WEEKEND_PATTERN:** This nudge is triggered when a user has a consistently different sentiment on weekends compared to weekdays.
- **MORNING_VS_EVENING:** This nudge is triggered when a user has a consistently different sentiment in the morning compared to the evening.

## Future Enhancements

- **More Sophisticated Rules:** The Nudge Engine could be enhanced with more sophisticated rules that take into account a wider range of factors, such as the user's goals, past nudges, and feedback.
- **Machine Learning:** A machine learning model could be used to generate more personalized and effective nudges.
- **User Feedback:** A system could be implemented to allow users to provide feedback on the nudges they receive. This feedback could be used to improve the Nudge Engine over time.
